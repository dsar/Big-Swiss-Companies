Lausanne, April 2016

### Abstract
Switzerland is well known for its long-lasting neutrality, its banking sector, beautiful landscapes and its chocolates. Beyond this context, which can be misleading in some cases, there is a solid reality concerning the high number of big, multinational and leading companies that are established on its territory. This reality becomes even more important when the relatively small size of Switzerland, both in terms of population and land, is considered. Some paradigmatic examples of such companies are Novartis, Nestlé, ABB and Logitech. While the histories of Novartis, Nestlé and ABB date back to the 18th (Novartis) and 19th (Nestlé, ABB) century, Logitech was founded in 1981, meaning that Switzerland was a center of pioneering activities throughout the last centuries.
The present research project investigates these four ‘Big Swiss Companies’ and attempts to highlight the aspects that have contributed to their success and domination starting from their establishment towards today. The following sequence: Novartis, Nestlé, ABB, Logitech is followed in the whole paper, based on how back they are rooted in the history. In Chapter 2, the overview and the history of each company is presented. This chapter illustrates, among others, the current status of each company, its general expansion strategy and the solutions it implemented during crisis. Undoubtedly, a comparison between Novartis, Nestlé, ABB and Logitech is essential in order to further illustrate their similarities and differences, inside the Swiss and international framework. Therefore, a comparison between them is conducted in Chapter 3. More specific, first their history is compared. Then, a Market Analysis is done. Finally, the companies are compared in terms of their Research and Development. Through the aforementioned comparisons, it was found that early expansion abroad, high diversification of business and strategy based on innovation were some of the main factors for their success.
